[Note 1: There is no way to write a function declaration that is non-throwing in this revision of C++ and is also
non-throwing in C++ 2003 except by using the preprocessor to generate a different token sequence in each case.—end
note]
C.3.10 Clause 16: library introduction [diff.cpp17.library]
1 Affected subclause:16.4.2.3
Change: New headers.
Rationale: New functionality.
Effect on original feature:The following C++ headers are new:<barrier> (32.9.3.2), <bit> (22.11.2),
<charconv> (28.2.1), <compare> (17.12.1), <concepts> (18.3), <coroutine> (17.13.2), <format> (28.5.1),
<latch>(32.9.2.2), <numbers>(29.8.1), <ranges>(25.2), <semaphore>(32.8.2), <source_location>(17.8.1),
<span> (23.7.2.1), <stop_token> (32.3.2), <syncstream> (31.11.1), and<version> (17.3.1). Valid C++ 2017
code that#includes headers with these names may be invalid in this revision of C++.
2 Affected subclause:16.4.2.3
Change: Remove vacuous C++ header files.
Rationale: The empty headers implied a false requirement to achieve C compatibility with the C++ headers.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that#includes any of the following headers may
fail to compile:<ccomplex>, <ciso646>, <cstdalign>, <cstdbool>, and<ctgmath>. To retain the same
behavior:
—(2.1) a #include of <ccomplex> can be replaced by a#include of <complex> (29.4.2),
—(2.2) a #include of <ctgmath> can be replaced by a#include of <cmath> (29.7.1) and a #include of
<complex>, and
—(2.3) a #include of <ciso646>, <cstdalign>, or<cstdbool> can simply be removed.
C.3.11 Clause 23: containers library [diff.cpp17.containers]
1 Affected subclauses:23.3.7 and 23.3.11
Change: Return types ofremove, remove_if, andunique changed fromvoid to container::size_type.
Rationale: Improve efficiency and convenience of finding number of removed elements.
Effect on original feature:Code that depends on the return types might have different semantics in this
revision of C++. Translation units compiled against this version of C++ may be incompatible with translation
units compiled against C++ 2017, either failing to link or having undefined behavior.
C.3.12 Clause 24: iterators library [diff.cpp17.iterators]
1 Affected subclause:24.3.2.3
Change: The specialization ofiterator_traits for void* and for function pointer types no longer contains
any nested typedefs.
Rationale: Corrects an issue misidentifying pointer types that are not incrementable as iterator types.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that relies on the presence of the typedefs may fail
to compile, or have different behavior.
C.3.13 Clause 26: algorithms library [diff.cpp17.alg.reqs]
1 Affected subclause:26.2
Change: The number and order of deducible template parameters for algorithm declarations is now
unspecified, instead of being as-declared.
Rationale: Increase implementor freedom and allow some function templates to be implemented as function
objects with templated call operators.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that passes explicit template arguments to algorithms
not explicitly specified to allow such in this version of C++ may fail to compile or have undefined behavior.
C.3.14 Clause 31: input/output library [diff.cpp17.input.output]
1 Affected subclause:31.7.5.3.3
Change: Character array extraction only takes array types.
Rationale: Increase safety via preventing buffer overflow at compile time.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2017 code may fail to compile in this revision of C++.

[Example 1:
auto p = new char[100];
char q[100];
std::cin >> std::setw(20) >> p; // ill-formed; previously well-formed
std::cin >> std::setw(20) >> q; // OK
—end example]
2 Affected subclause:31.7.6.3.4
Change: Overload resolution for ostream inserters used with UTF-8 literals.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2017 code that passes UTF-8 literals tobasic_ostream<char,
...>::operator<< or basic_ostream<wchar_t, ...>::operator<< is now ill-formed.
[Example 2:
std::cout << u8"text"; // previously calledoperator<<(const char*) and printed a string;
// now ill-formed
std::cout << u8'X'; // previously calledoperator<<(char) and printed a character;
// now ill-formed
—end example]
3 Affected subclause:31.7.6.3.4
Change: Overload resolution for ostream inserters used withwchar_t, char16_t, orchar32_t types.
Rationale: Removal of surprising behavior.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2017 code that passeswchar_t, char16_t, orchar32_t characters
or strings tobasic_ostream<char, ...>::operator<< or that passeschar16_t or char32_t characters or
strings tobasic_ostream<wchar_t, ...>::operator<< is now ill-formed.
[Example 3:
std::cout << u"text"; // previously formatted the string as a pointer value;
// now ill-formed
std::cout << u'X'; // previously formatted the character as an integer value;
// now ill-formed
—end example]
4 Affected subclause:31.12.6
Change: Return type of filesystem path format observer member functions.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2017 code that depends on theu8string()andgeneric_u8string()
member functions ofstd::filesystem::path returning std::string is not valid in this revision of C++.
[Example 4:
std::filesystem::path p;
std::string s1 = p.u8string(); // ill-formed; previously well-formed
std::string s2 = p.generic_u8string(); // ill-formed; previously well-formed
—end example]
C.3.15 Annex D: compatibility features [diff.cpp17.depr]
1 Change: Remove uncaught_exception.
Rationale: The function did not have a clear specification when multiple exceptions were active, and has
been superseded byuncaught_exceptions.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that callsstd::uncaught_exception may fail to
compile. It can be revised to usestd::uncaught_exceptions instead, for clear and portable semantics.
2 Change: Remove support for adaptable function API.
Rationale: The deprecated support relied on a limited convention that could not be extended to support
the general case or new language features. It has been superseded by direct language support withdecltype,
and by thestd::bind and std::not_fn function templates.
Effect on original feature: A valid C++ 2017 program that relies on the presence ofresult_type,
argument_type, first_argument_type, orsecond_argument_type in a standard library class may fail to
compile. A valid C++ 2017 program that callsnot1 or not2, or uses the class templatesunary_negate or
binary_negate, may fail to compile.
§ C.3.15 © ISO/IEC

===== PAGE 2403 =====

Dxxxx
3 Change: Remove redundant members fromstd::allocator.
Rationale: std::allocator was overspecified, encouraging direct usage in user containers rather than
relying onstd::allocator_traits, leading to poor containers.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that directly makes use of thepointer, const_-
pointer, reference, const_reference, rebind, address, construct, destroy, ormax_size members of
std::allocator, or that directly callsallocate with an additional hint argument, may fail to compile.
4 Change: Remove raw_storage_iterator.
Rationale: The iterator encouraged use of potentially-throwing algorithms, but did not return the number
of elements successfully constructed, as would be necessary to destroy them.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that uses this iterator class may fail to compile.
5 Change: Remove temporary buffers API.
Rationale: The temporary buffer facility was intended to provide an efficient optimization for small memory
requests, but there is little evidence this was achieved in practice, while requiring the user to provide their
own exception-safe wrappers to guard use of the facility in many cases.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that callsget_temporary_buffer or return_-
temporary_buffer may fail to compile.
6 Change: Remove shared_ptr::unique.
Rationale: The result of a call to this member function is not reliable in the presence of multiple threads
and weak pointers. The member functionuse_count is similarly unreliable, but has a clearer contract in
such cases, and remains available for well-defined use in single-threaded cases.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that callsunique on ashared_ptr object may fail
to compile.
7 Affected subclause:D.13
Change: Remove deprecated type traits.
Rationale: The traits had unreliable or awkward interfaces. Theis_literal_type trait provided no way
to detect which subset of member functions of a type were declaredconstexpr. The result_of trait had a
surprising syntax that did not directly support function types. It has been superseded by theinvoke_result
trait.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2017 program that relies on theis_literal_type or result_of
type traits, on theis_literal_type_v variable template, or on theresult_of_t alias template may fail to
compile.
C.4 C ++ and ISO C++ 2014 [diff.cpp14]
C.4.1 General [diff.cpp14.general]
1 Subclause C.4 lists the differences between C++ and ISO C++ 2014, in addition to those listed above, by the
chapters of this document.
C.4.2 Clause 5: lexical conventions [diff.cpp14.lex]
1 Affected subclause:5.2
Change: Removal of trigraph support as a required feature.
Rationale: Prevents accidental uses of trigraphs in non-raw string literals and comments.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code that uses trigraphs may not be valid or may have different
semantics in this revision of C++. Implementations may choose to translate trigraphs as specified in C++
2014 if they appear outside of a raw string literal, as part of the implementation-defined mapping from input
source file characters to the translation character set.
2 Affected subclause:5.7
Change: pp-number can containp sign and P sign.
Rationale: Necessary to enablehexadecimal-floating-point-literals.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++. Specifically, character sequences like0p+0 and 0e1_p+0 are three separate tokens each in
C++ 2014, but one single token in this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
#define F(a) b ## a
int b0p = F(0p+0); // ill-formed; equivalent to “int b0p = b0p + 0;” in C++ 2014
—end example]

===== PAGE 2404 =====

Dxxxx
C.4.3 Clause 7: expressions [diff.cpp14.expr]
1 Affected subclauses:7.6.1.6 and 7.6.2.3
Change: Remove increment operator withbool operand.
Rationale: Obsolete feature with occasionally surprising semantics.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2014 expression utilizing the increment operator on abool lvalue
is ill-formed in this revision of C++.
2 Affected subclauses:7.6.2.8 and 7.6.2.9
Change: Dynamic allocation mechanism for over-aligned types.
Rationale: Simplify use of over-aligned types.
Effect on original feature:In C++ 2014 code that uses anew-expression to allocate an object with an over-
aligned class type, where that class has no allocation functions of its own,::operator new(std::size_t) is
used to allocate the memory. In this revision of C++, ::operator new(std::size_t, std::align_val_t)
is used instead.
C.4.4 Clause 9: declarations [diff.cpp14.dcl.dcl]
1 Affected subclause:9.2.2
Change: Removal ofregister storage-class-specifier.
Rationale: Enable repurposing of deprecated keyword in future revisions of C++.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2014 declaration utilizing theregister storage-class-specifier is
ill-formed in this revision of C++. The specifier can simply be removed to retain the original meaning.
2 Affected subclause:9.2.9.7
Change: auto deduction frombraced-init-list.
Rationale: More intuitive deduction behavior.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or may change meaning in this
revision of C++.
[Example 1:
auto x1{1}; // wasstd::initializer_list<int>, now int
auto x2{1, 2}; // wasstd::initializer_list<int>, now ill-formed
—end example]
3 Affected subclause:9.3.4.6
Change: Make exception specifications be part of the type system.
Rationale: Improve type-safety.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or change meaning in this revision of
C++.
[Example 2:
void g1() noexcept;
void g2();
template<class T> int f(T *, T *);
int x = f(g1, g2); // ill-formed; previously well-formed
—end example]
4 Affected subclause:9.5.2
Change: Definition of an aggregate is extended to apply to user-defined types with base classes.
Rationale: To increase convenience of aggregate initialization.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++; initialization from an empty initializer list will perform aggregate initialization instead of
invoking a default constructor for the affected types.
[Example 3:
struct derived;
struct base {
friend struct derived;
private:
base();
};
struct derived : base {};

derived d1{}; // error; the code was well-formed in C++ 2014
derived d2; // still OK
—end example]
C.4.5 Clause 11: classes [diff.cpp14.class]
1 Affected subclause:11.9.4
Change: Inheriting a constructor no longer injects a constructor into the derived class.
Rationale: Better interaction with other language features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code that uses inheriting constructors may not be valid or
may have different semantics. Ausing-declaration that names a constructor now makes the corresponding
base class constructors visible to initializations of the derived class rather than declaring additional derived
class constructors.
[Example 1:
struct A {
template<typename T> A(T, typename T::type = 0);
A(int);
};
struct B : A {
using A::A;
B(int);
};
B b(42L); // now callsB(int), used to callB<long>(long),
// which calledA(int) due to substitution failure
// in A<long>(long).
—end example]
C.4.6 Clause 13: templates [diff.cpp14.temp]
1 Affected subclause:13.10.3.6
Change: Allowance to deduce from the type of a constant template argument.
Rationale: In combination with the ability to declare constant template arguments with placeholder types,
allows partial specializations to decompose from the type deduced for the constant template argument.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++.
[Example 1:
template <int N> struct A;
template <typename T, T N> int foo(A<N> *) = delete;
void foo(void *);
void bar(A<0> *p) {
foo(p); // ill-formed; previously well-formed
}
—end example]
C.4.7 Clause 14: exception handling [diff.cpp14.except]
1 Affected subclause:14.5
Change: Remove dynamic exception specifications.
Rationale: Dynamic exception specifications were a deprecated feature that was complex and brittle in use.
They interacted badly with the type system, which became a more significant issue in this revision of C++
where (non-dynamic) exception specifications are part of the function type.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2014 function declaration, member function declaration, function
pointer declaration, or function reference declaration, if it has a potentially throwing dynamic exception
specification, is rejected as ill-formed in this revision of C++. Violating a non-throwing dynamic exception
specification calls terminate rather than unexpected, and it is unspecified whether stack unwinding is
performed prior to such a call.
C.4.8 Clause 16: library introduction [diff.cpp14.library]
1 Affected subclause:16.4.2.3
Change: New headers.
§ C.4.8 © ISO/IEC
2394

===== PAGE 2406 =====

Dxxxx
Rationale: New functionality.
Effect on original feature:The following C++ headers are new: <any> (22.7.2), <charconv> (28.2.1),
<execution> (33.4), <filesystem> (31.12.4), <memory_resource> (20.5.1), <optional> (22.5.2),
<string_view> (27.3.2), and<variant> (22.6.2). Valid C++ 2014 code that#includes headers with these
names may be invalid in this revision of C++.
2 Affected subclause:16.4.5.2.3
Change: New reserved namespaces.
Rationale: Reserve namespaces for future revisions of the standard library that might otherwise be
incompatible with existing programs.
Effect on original feature:The global namespacesstd followed by an arbitrary sequence ofdigits (5.11)
are reserved for future standardization. Valid C++ 2014 code that uses such a top-level namespace, e.g.,std2,
may be invalid in this revision of C++.
C.4.9 Clause 22: general utilities library [diff.cpp14.utilities]
1 Affected subclause:22.10.17
Change: Constructors taking allocators removed.
Rationale: No implementation consensus.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or may change meaning in this
revision of C++. Specifically, constructing astd::function with an allocator is ill-formed and uses-allocator
construction will not pass an allocator tostd::function constructors in this revision of C++.
2 Affected subclause:20.3.2.2
Change: Different constraint on conversions fromunique_ptr.
Rationale: Adding array support toshared_ptr, via the syntaxshared_ptr<T[]>andshared_ptr<T[N]>.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code may fail to compile or may change meaning in this
revision of C++.
[Example 1:
#include <memory>
std::unique_ptr<int[]> arr(new int[1]);
std::shared_ptr<int> ptr(std::move(arr)); // error: int(*)[] is not compatible withint*
—end example]
C.4.10 Clause 27: strings library [diff.cpp14.string]
1 Affected subclause:27.4.3
Change: Non-const .data() member added.
Rationale: The lack of a non-const.data() differed from the similar member ofstd::vector. This change
regularizes behavior.
Effect on original feature:Overloaded functions which have differing code paths forchar* and const
char* arguments will execute differently when called with a non-const string’s.data() member in this
revision of C++.
[Example 1:
int f(char *) = delete;
int f(const char *);
string s;
int x = f(s.data()); // ill-formed; previously well-formed
—end example]
C.4.11 Clause 23: containers library [diff.cpp14.containers]
1 Affected subclause:23.2.7
Change: Requirements change:
Rationale: Increase portability, clarification of associative container requirements.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code that attempts to use associative containers having a
comparison object with non-const function call operator may fail to compile in this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
#include <set>
§ C.4.11 © ISO/IEC

struct compare
{
bool operator()(int a, int b)
{
return a < b;
}
};
int main() {
const std::set<int, compare> s;
s.find(0);
}
—end example]
C.4.12 Annex D: compatibility features [diff.cpp14.depr]
1 Change: The class templatesauto_ptr, unary_function, andbinary_function, the function templates
random_shuffle, and the function templates (and their return types)ptr_fun, mem_fun, mem_fun_ref,
bind1st, andbind2nd are not defined.
Rationale: Superseded by new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2014 code that uses these class templates and function templates
may fail to compile in this revision of C++.
2 Change: Remove old iostreams members [depr.ios.members].
Rationale: Redundant feature for compatibility with pre-standard code has served its time.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2014 program using these identifiers may be ill-formed in this
revision of C++.
C.5 C ++ and ISO C++ 2011 [diff.cpp11]
C.5.1 General [diff.cpp11.general]
1 Subclause C.5 lists the differences between C++ and ISO C++ 2011, in addition to those listed above, by the
chapters of this document.
C.5.2 Clause 5: lexical conventions [diff.cpp11.lex]
1 Affected subclause:5.7
Change: pp-number can contain one or more single quotes.
Rationale: Necessary to enable single quotes as digit separators.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code may fail to compile or may change meaning in this
revision of C++. For example, the following code is valid both in C++ 2011 and in this revision of C++, but
the macro invocation produces different outcomes because the single quotes delimit acharacter-literal in C++
2011, whereas they are digit separators in this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
#define M(x, ...) __VA_ARGS__
int x[2] = { M(1'2,3'4, 5) };
// int x[2] = { 5 }; — C++ 2011
// int x[2] = { 3’4, 5 }; — this revision of C++
—end example]
C.5.3 Clause 6: basics [diff.cpp11.basic]
1 Affected subclause:6.8.6.5.3
Change: New usual (non-placement) deallocator.
Rationale: Required for sized deallocation.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code can declare a global placement allocation function and
deallocation function as follows:
void* operator new(std::size_t, std::size_t);
void operator delete(void*, std::size_t) noexcept;
In this revision of C++, however, the declaration ofoperator delete might match a predefined usual
(non-placement) operator delete (6.8.6.5). If so, the program is ill-formed, as it was for class member
allocation functions and deallocation functions (7.6.2.8).
§ C.5.3 © ISO/IEC
2396

===== PAGE 2408 =====

Dxxxx
C.5.4 Clause 7: expressions [diff.cpp11.expr]
1 Affected subclause:7.6.16
Change: A conditional expression with a throw expression as its second or third operand keeps the type
and value category of the other operand.
Rationale: Formerly mandated conversions (lvalue-to-rvalue (7.3.2), array-to-pointer (7.3.3), and function-
to-pointer (7.3.4) standard conversions), especially the creation of the temporary due to lvalue-to-rvalue
conversion, were considered gratuitous and surprising.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code that relies on the conversions may behave differently in
this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
struct S {
int x = 1;
void mf() { x = 2; }
};
int f(bool cond) {
S s;
(cond ? s : throw 0).mf();
return s.x;
}
In C++ 2011, f(true) returns 1. In this revision of C++, it returns2.
sizeof(true ? "" : throw 0)
In C++ 2011, the expression yieldssizeof(const char*). In this revision of C++, it yieldssizeof(const char[1]).
—end example]
C.5.5 Clause 9: declarations [diff.cpp11.dcl.dcl]
1 Affected subclause:9.2.6
Change: constexpr non-static member functions are not implicitlyconst member functions.
Rationale: Necessary to allowconstexpr member functions to mutate the object.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code may fail to compile in this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
struct S {
constexpr const int &f();
int &f();
};
This code is valid in C++ 2011 but invalid in this revision of C++ because it declares the same member function twice
with different return types.—end example]
2 Affected subclause:9.5.2
Change: Classes with default member initializers can be aggregates.
Rationale: Necessary to allow default member initializers to be used by aggregate initialization.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code may fail to compile or may change meaning in this
revision of C++.
[Example 2:
struct S { // Aggregate in C++ 2014 onwards.
int m = 1;
};
struct X {
operator int();
operator S();
};
X a{};
S b{a}; // uses copy constructor in C++ 2011,
// performs aggregate initialization in this revision of C++
—end example]
C.5.6 Clause 16: library introduction [diff.cpp11.library]
1 Affected subclause:16.4.2.3
Change: New header.
§ C.5.6 © ISO/IEC
2397

===== PAGE 2409 =====

Dxxxx
Rationale: New functionality.
Effect on original feature:The C++ header <shared_mutex> (32.6.3) is new. Valid C++ 2011 code that
#includes a header with that name may be invalid in this revision of C++.
C.5.7 Clause 31: input/output library [diff.cpp11.input.output]
1 Affected subclause:31.13
Change: gets is not defined.
Rationale: Use ofgets is considered dangerous.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2011 code that uses thegets function may fail to compile in this
revision of C++.
C.6 C ++ and ISO C++ 2003 [diff.cpp03]
C.6.1 General [diff.cpp03.general]
1 Subclause C.6 lists the differences between C++ and ISO C++ 2003, in addition to those listed above, by the
chapters of this document.
C.6.2 Clause 5: lexical conventions [diff.cpp03.lex]
1 Affected subclause:5.5
Change: New kinds ofstring-literals.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++. Specifically, macros namedR, u8, u8R, u, uR, U, UR, orLR will not be expanded when adjacent
to astring-literal but will be interpreted as part of thestring-literal.
[Example 1:
#define u8 "abc"
const char* s = u8"def"; // Previously"abcdef", now "def"
—end example]
2 Affected subclause:5.5
Change: User-defined literal string support.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++.
[Example 2:
#define _x "there"
"hello"_x // #1
Previously, #1 would have consisted of two separate preprocessing tokens and the macro_x would have been expanded.
In this revision of C++, #1 consists of a single preprocessing token, so the macro is not expanded.—end example]
3 Affected subclause:5.12
Change: New keywords.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Added to Table 5, the following identifiers are new keywords:alignas, alignof,
char16_t, char32_t, constexpr, decltype, noexcept, nullptr, static_assert, andthread_local. Valid
C++ 2003 code using these identifiers is invalid in this revision of C++.
4 Affected subclause:5.13.2
Change: Type of integer literals.
Rationale: C99 compatibility.
Effect on original feature:Certain integer literals larger than can be represented bylong could change
from an unsigned integer type tosigned long long.
C.6.3 Clause 7: expressions [diff.cpp03.expr]
1 Affected subclause:7.3.12
Change: Only literals are integer null pointer constants.
Rationale: Removing surprising interactions with templates and constant expressions.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++.

2 Affected subclause:7.6.1.8
Change: Evaluation of operands intypeid.
Rationale: Introduce additional expression value categories.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses xvalues as operands fortypeid may change
behavior in this revision of C++.
[Example 2:
void f() {
struct B {

typeid(C().b); // unevaluated in C++ 2003, evaluated in C++ 2011
}
—end example]
3 Affected subclause:7.6.5
Change: Specify rounding for results of integer/ and %.
Rationale: Increase portability, C99 compatibility.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses integer division rounds the result toward 0 or
toward negative infinity, whereas this revision of C++ always rounds the result toward 0.
4 Affected subclause:7.6.14
Change: && is valid in atype-name.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may fail to compile or produce different results in this
revision of C++.
[Example 3:
bool b1 = new int && false; // previouslyfalse, now ill-formed
struct S { operator int(); };
bool b2 = &S::operator int && false; // previouslyfalse, now ill-formed
—end example]
5 Affected subclause:7.6.16
Change: Fewer copies in the conditional operator.
Rationale: Introduce additional expression value categories.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses xvalues as operands for the conditional operator
may change behavior in this revision of C++.
[Example 4:
void f() {
struct B {
B() {}
B(const B&) { }
};
struct D : B {};
struct BB { B b; };
struct DD { D d; };
true ? BB().b : DD().d; // additional copy in C++ 2003, no copy or move in C++ 2011
}

C.6.4 Clause 9: declarations [diff.cpp03.dcl.dcl]
1 Affected subclause:9.2
Change: Remove auto as a storage class specifier.
Rationale: New feature.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses the keywordauto as a storage class specifier
may be invalid in this revision of C++. In this revision of C++, auto indicates that the type of a variable is
to be deduced from its initializer expression.
2 Affected subclause:9.5.5
Change: Narrowing restrictions in aggregate initializers.
Rationale: Catches bugs.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may fail to compile in this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
int x[] = { 2.0 };
This code is valid in C++ 2003 but invalid in this revision of C++ because double to int is a narrowing conversion.
—end example]
3 Affected subclause:9.12
Change: Names declared in an anonymous namespace changed from external linkage to internal linkage;
language linkage applies to names with external linkage only.
Rationale: Alignment with user expectations.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may violate the one-definition rule (6.3) in this revision
of C++.
[Example 2:
namespace { extern "C" { extern int x; } } // #1, previously external linkage and C language linkage,
// now internal linkage and C++ language linkage
namespace A { extern "C" int x = 42; } // #2, external linkage and C language linkage
int main(void) { return x; }
This code is valid in C++ 2003, but#2 is not a definition for#1 in this revision of C++, violating the one-definition
rule. —end example]
C.6.5 Clause 11: classes [diff.cpp03.class]
1 Affected subclauses:11.4.5.2, 11.4.7, 11.4.5.3, and 11.4.6
Change: Implicitly-declared special member functions are defined as deleted when the implicit definition
would have been ill-formed.
Rationale: Improves template argument deduction failure.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2003 program that uses one of these special member functions
in a context where the definition is not required (e.g., in an expression that is not potentially evaluated)
becomes ill-formed.
2 Affected subclause:11.4.7
Change: User-declared destructors have an implicit exception specification.
Rationale: Clarification of destructor requirements.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may execute differently in this revision of C++. In
particular, destructors that throw exceptions will callstd::terminate (without callingstd::unexpected)
if their exception specification is non-throwing.
C.6.6 Clause 13: templates [diff.cpp03.temp]
1 Affected subclause:13.2
Change: Repurpose export for modules (Clause 10, 15.5, 15.6).
Rationale: No implementation consensus for the C++ 2003 meaning ofexport.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2003 program containingexport is ill-formed in this revision of
C++.
2 Affected subclause:13.4
Change: Remove whitespace requirement for nested closing template right angle brackets.
Rationale: Considered a persistent but minor annoyance. Template aliases representing non-class types
would exacerbate whitespace issues.
§ C.6.6 © ISO/IEC
2400

===== PAGE 2412 =====

Dxxxx
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined expression. A valid C++ 2003 expression
containing a right angle bracket (“>”) followed immediately by another right angle bracket may now be
treated as closing two templates.
[Example 1:
template <class T> struct X { };
template <int N> struct Y { };
X< Y< 1 >> 2 > > x;
This code is valid in C++ 2003 because “>>” is a right-shift operator, but invalid in this revision of C++ because “>>”
closes two templates.—end example]
3 Affected subclause:13.8.4.2
Change: Allow dependent calls of functions with internal linkage.
Rationale: Overly constrained, simplify overload resolution rules.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2003 program can get a different result in this revision of C++.
C.6.7 Clause 16: library introduction [diff.cpp03.library]
1 Affected: Clause 16 – Clause 33
Change: New reserved identifiers.
Rationale: Required by new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses any identifiers added to the C++ standard
library by later revisions of C++ may fail to compile or produce different results in this revision of C++.
A comprehensive list of identifiers used by the C++ standard library can be found in the Index of Library
Names in this document.
2 Affected subclause:16.4.2.3
Change: New headers.
Rationale: New functionality.
Effect on original feature:The following C++ headers are new: <array> (23.3.2), <atomic> (32.5.2),
<chrono>(30.2), <condition_variable>(32.7.2), <forward_list>(23.3.6), <future>(32.10.2), <initiali-
zer_list> (17.11.2), <mutex> (32.6.2), <random> (29.5.2), <ratio> (21.5.2), <regex> (28.6.3), <scoped_-
allocator> (20.6.1), <system_error> (19.5.2), <thread> (32.4.2), <tuple> (22.4.2), <typeindex> (17.7.6),
<type_traits>(21.3.3), <unordered_map>(23.5.2), and<unordered_set>(23.5.5). In addition the following
C compatibility headers are new:<cfenv>(29.3.1), <cinttypes>(31.13.2), <cstdint>(17.4.1), and<cuchar>
(28.7.4). Valid C++ 2003 code that#includes headers with these names may be invalid in this revision of
C++.
3 Affected subclause:16.4.4.3
Change: Function swap moved to a different header.
Rationale: Remove dependency on<algorithm> (26.4) forswap.
Effect on original feature: Valid C++ 2003 code that has been compiled expecting swap to be in
<algorithm> (26.4) may have to instead include<utility> (22.2.1).
4 Affected subclause:16.4.5.2.2
Change: New reserved namespace.
Rationale: New functionality.
Effect on original feature:The global namespaceposix is now reserved for standardization. Valid C++
2003 code that uses a top-level namespaceposix may be invalid in this revision of C++.
5 Affected subclause:16.4.5.3.3
Change: Additional restrictions on macro names.
Rationale: Avoid hard to diagnose or non-portable constructs.
Effect on original feature:Names of attribute identifiers may not be used as macro names. Valid C++
2003 code that definesoverride, final, ornoreturn as macros is invalid in this revision of C++.
C.6.8 Clause 17: language support library [diff.cpp03.language.support]
1 Affected subclause:17.6.3.2
Change: operator new may throw exceptions other thanstd::bad_alloc.
Rationale: Consistent application ofnoexcept.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that assumes that globaloperator new only throws
std::bad_alloc may execute differently in this revision of C++. Valid C++ 2003 code that replaces the
§ C.6.8 © ISO/IEC
2401

===== PAGE 2413 =====

Dxxxx
global replaceableoperator new is ill-formed in this revision of C++, because the exception specification of
throw(std::bad_alloc) was removed.
C.6.9 Clause 19: diagnostics library [diff.cpp03.diagnostics]
1 Affected subclause:19.4
Change: Thread-local error numbers.
Rationale: Support for new thread facilities.
Effect on original feature:Valid but implementation-specific C++ 2003 code that relies onerrno being
the same across threads may change behavior in this revision of C++.
C.6.10 Clause 22: general utilities library [diff.cpp03.utilities]
1 Affected subclauses:22.10.6, 22.10.7, 22.10.8, 22.10.10, and 22.10.11
Change: Standard function object types no longer derived fromstd::unary_function or std::binary_-
function.
Rationale: Superseded by new feature;unary_function and binary_function are no longer defined.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that depends on function object types being derived from
unary_function or binary_function may fail to compile in this revision of C++.
C.6.11 Clause 27: strings library [diff.cpp03.strings]
1 Affected subclause:27.4
Change: basic_string requirements no longer allow reference-counted strings.
Rationale: Invalidation is subtly different with reference-counted strings. This change regularizes behavior.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may execute differently in this revision of C++.
2 Affected subclause:27.4.3.2
Change: Loosen basic_string invalidation rules.
Rationale: Allow small-string optimization.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may execute differently in this revision of C++. Some
const member functions, such asdata and c_str, no longer invalidate iterators.
C.6.12 Clause 23: containers library [diff.cpp03.containers]
1 Affected subclause:23.2
Change: Complexity ofsize() member functions now constant.
Rationale: Lack of specification of complexity ofsize() resulted in divergent implementations with
inconsistent performance characteristics.
Effect on original feature:Some container implementations that conform to C++ 2003 may not conform
to the specifiedsize() requirements in this revision of C++. Adjusting containers such asstd::list to the
stricter requirements may require incompatible changes.
2 Affected subclause:23.2
Change: Requirements change: relaxation.
Rationale: Clarification.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that attempts to meet the specified container requirements
may now be over-specified. Code that attempted to be portable across containers may need to be adjusted as
follows:
—(2.1) not all containers providesize(); useempty() instead ofsize() == 0;
—(2.2) not all containers are empty after construction (array);
—(2.3) not all containers have constant complexity forswap() (array).
3 Affected subclause:23.2
Change: Requirements change: default constructible.
Rationale: Clarification of container requirements.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that attempts to explicitly instantiate a container using a
user-defined type with no default constructor may fail to compile.
4 Affected subclauses:23.2.4 and 23.2.7
Change: Signature changes: fromvoid return types.
Rationale: Old signature threw away useful information that may be expensive to recalculate.
Effect on original feature:The following member functions have changed:
§ C.6.12 © ISO/IEC
2402

===== PAGE 2414 =====

Dxxxx
—(4.1) erase(iter) for set, multiset, map, multimap
—(4.2) erase(begin, end) for set, multiset, map, multimap
—(4.3) insert(pos, num, val) for vector, deque, list, forward_list
—(4.4) insert(pos, beg, end) for vector, deque, list, forward_list
Valid C++ 2003 code that relies on these functions returningvoid (e.g., code that creates a pointer to member
function that points to one of these functions) will fail to compile with this revision of C++.
5 Affected subclauses:23.2.4 and 23.2.7
Change: Signature changes: fromiterator to const_iterator parameters.
Rationale: Overspecification.
Effect on original feature:The signatures of the following member functions changed from taking an
iterator to taking aconst_iterator:
—(5.1) insert(iter, val) for vector, deque, list, set, multiset, map, multimap
—(5.2) insert(pos, beg, end) for vector, deque, list, forward_list
—(5.3) erase(begin, end) for set, multiset, map, multimap
—(5.4) all forms oflist::splice
—(5.5) all forms oflist::merge
Valid C++ 2003 code that uses these functions may fail to compile with this revision of C++.
6 Affected subclauses:23.2.4 and 23.2.7
Change: Signature changes:resize.
Rationale: Performance, compatibility with move semantics.
Effect on original feature:For vector, deque, andlist the fill value passed toresize is now passed by
reference instead of by value, and an additional overload ofresize has been added. Valid C++ 2003 code
that uses this function may fail to compile with this revision of C++.
C.6.13 Clause 26: algorithms library [diff.cpp03.algorithms]
1 Affected subclause:26.1
Change: Result state of inputs after application of some algorithms.
Rationale: Required by new feature.
Effect on original feature:A valid C++ 2003 program may detect that an object with a valid but unspecified
state has a different valid but unspecified state with this revision of C++. For example,std::remove and
std::remove_if may leave the tail of the input sequence with a different set of values than previously.
C.6.14 Clause 29: numerics library [diff.cpp03.numerics]
1 Affected subclause:29.4
Change: Specified representation of complex numbers.
Rationale: Compatibility with C99.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that uses implementation-specific knowledge about the
binary representation of the required template specializations ofstd::complex may not be compatible with
this revision of C++.
C.6.15 28.3: localization library [diff.cpp03.locale]
1 Affected subclause:28.3.4.3.2.3
Change: The num_get facet recognizes hexadecimal floating-point values.
Rationale: Required by new feature.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code may have different behavior in this revision of C++.
C.6.16 Clause 31: input/output library [diff.cpp03.input.output]
1 Affected subclauses:31.7.5.2.4, 31.7.6.2.4, and 31.5.4.4
Change: Specify use ofexplicit in existing boolean conversion functions.
Rationale: Clarify intentions, avoid workarounds.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that relies on implicit boolean conversions will fail to
compile with this revision of C++. Such conversions occur in the following conditions:
—(1.1) passing a value to a function that takes an argument of typebool;
§ C.6.16 © ISO/IEC
2403

===== PAGE 2415 =====

Dxxxx
—(1.2) using operator== to compare tofalse or true;
—(1.3) returning a value from a function with a return type ofbool;
—(1.4) initializing members of typebool via aggregate initialization;
—(1.5) initializing aconst bool& which would bind to a temporary object.
2 Affected subclause:31.5.2.2.1
Change: Change base class ofstd::ios_base::failure.
Rationale: More detailed error messages.
Effect on original feature:std::ios_base::failure is no longer derived directly fromstd::exception,
but is now derived fromstd::system_error, which in turn is derived fromstd::runtime_error. Valid
C++ 2003 code that assumes thatstd::ios_base::failure is derived directly fromstd::exception may
execute differently in this revision of C++.
3 Affected subclause:31.5.2
Change: Flag types instd::ios_base are now bitmasks with values defined as constexpr static members.
Rationale: Required for new features.
Effect on original feature:Valid C++ 2003 code that relies onstd::ios_base flag types being represented
as std::bitset or as an integer type may fail to compile with this revision of C++.
[Example 1:
#include <iostream>
int main() {
int flag = std::ios_base::hex;
std::cout.setf(flag); // error: setf does not take argument of typeint
}
—end example]
C.7 C ++ and C [diff.iso]
C.7.1 General [diff.iso.general]
1 Subclause C.7 lists the differences between C++ and C, in addition to those listed above, by the chapters of
this document.
C.7.2 Clause 5: lexical conventions [diff.lex]
1 Affected subclause:5.12
Change: New Keywords.
New keywords are added to C++; see 5.12.
Rationale: These keywords were added in order to implement the new semantics of C++.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature. Any C programs that used any of
these keywords as identifiers are not valid C++ programs.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation. Converting one specific program is easy. Converting a
large collection of related programs takes more work.
How widely used:Common.
2 Affected subclause:5.13.3
Change: Type ofcharacter-literal is changed fromint to char.
Rationale: This is needed for improved overloaded function argument type matching.
[Example 1:
int function( int i );
int function( char c );
function( 'x' );
It is preferable that this call match the second version of function rather than the first.—end example]
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature. C programs which depend on
sizeof('x') == sizeof(int)
will not work the same as C++ programs.
Difficulty of converting:Simple.
How widely used:Programs which depend uponsizeof(’x’) are probably rare.
§ C.7.2 © ISO/IEC
2404

===== PAGE 2416 =====

Dxxxx
3 Affected subclause:5.13.5
Change: Concatenated string-literals can no longer have conflictingencoding-prefixes.
Rationale: Removal of non-portable feature.
Effect on original feature:Concatenation ofstring-literals with differentencoding-prefixes is now ill-formed.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
4 Affected subclause:5.13.5
Change: String literals made const.
The type of astring-literal is changed from “array ofchar” to “array ofconst char”. The type of a UTF-8
string literal is changed from “array ofchar” to “array ofconst char8_t”. The type of a UTF-16 string
literal is changed from “array ofsome-integer-type” to “array ofconst char16_t”. The type of a UTF-32
string literal is changed from “array ofsome-integer-type” to “array ofconst char32_t”. The type of a wide
string literal is changed from “array ofwchar_t” to “array ofconst wchar_t”.
Rationale: This avoids calling an inappropriate overloaded function, which might expect to be able to
modify its argument.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation. The fix is to add a cast:
char* p = "abc"; // valid in C, invalid in C++
void f(char*) {
char* p = (char*)"abc"; // OK, cast added
f(p);
f((char*)"def"); // OK, cast added
}
How widely used:Programs that have a legitimate reason to treat string literal objects as potentially
modifiable memory are probably rare.
C.7.3 Clause 6: basics [diff.basic]
1 Affected subclause:6.2
Change: C++ does not have “tentative definitions” as in C.
[Example 1: At file scope,
int i;
int i;
is valid in C, invalid in C++. —end example]
This makes it impossible to define mutually referential file-local objects with static storage duration, if
initializers are restricted to the syntactic forms of C.
[Example 2:
struct X { int i; struct X* next; };
static struct X a;
static struct X b = { 0, &a };
static struct X a = { 1, &b };
—end example]
Rationale: This avoids having different initialization rules for fundamental types and user-defined types.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. In C++, the initializer for one of a set of mutually-
referentialfile-localobjectswithstaticstoragedurationmustinvokeafunctioncalltoachievetheinitialization.
How widely used:Seldom.
2 Affected subclause:6.4
Change: A struct is a scope in C++, not in C.
[Example 3:
struct X {
struct Y { int a; } b;
};
struct Y c;
is valid in C but not in C++, which would requireX::Y c;. —end example]
§ C.7.3 © ISO/IEC
2405

===== PAGE 2417 =====

Dxxxx
Rationale: Class scope is crucial to C++, and a struct is a class.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:C programs usestruct extremely frequently, but the change is only noticeable when
struct, enumeration, or enumerator names are referred to outside thestruct. The latter is probably rare.
3 Affected subclause:6.7 [also 9.2.9]
Change: A name of file scope that is explicitly declaredconst, and not explicitly declaredextern, has
internal linkage, while in C it would have external linkage.
Rationale: Because const objects may be used as values during translation in C++, this feature urges
programmers to provide an explicit initializer for each const object. This feature allows the user to put const
objects in source files that are included in more than one translation unit.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
4 Affected subclause:6.10.3.1
Change: The main function cannot be called recursively and cannot have its address taken.
Rationale: The main function may require special actions.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Trivial: create an intermediary function such asmymain(argc, argv).
How widely used:Seldom.
5 Affected subclause:6.9
Change: C allows “compatible types” in several places, C++ does not.
For example, otherwise-identicalstruct types with different tag names are “compatible” in C but are
distinctly different types in C++.
Rationale: Stricter type checking is essential for C++.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. The “typesafe linkage” mechanism will find many, but
not all, of such problems. Those problems not found by typesafe linkage will continue to function properly,
according to the “layout compatibility rules” of this document.
How widely used:Common.
C.7.4 Clause 7: expressions [diff.expr]
1 Affected subclause:7.3.12
Change: Converting a prvalue of type “pointer tocv void” to a pointer-to-object type requires casting.
[Example 1:
char a[10];
void* b=a;
void foo() {
char* c=b;
}
C accepts this usage of “pointer tovoid” being assigned to a pointer to object type. C++ does not. —end example]
Rationale: C++ tries harder than C to enforce compile-time type safety.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Can be automated. Violations will be diagnosed by the C++ translator. The fix
is to add a cast.
[Example 2:
char* c = (char*) b;
—end example]
How widely used:Common.
2 Affected subclause:7.4
Change: Operations mixing a value of an enumeration type and a value of a different enumeration type or
of a floating-point type are not valid.
[Example 3:
enum E1 { e };
§ C.7.4 © ISO/IEC
2406

===== PAGE 2418 =====

Dxxxx
enum E2 { f };
int b = e <= 3.7; // valid in C; ill-formed in C++
int k = f - e; // valid in C; ill-formed in C++
int x = 1 ? e : f; // valid in C; ill-formed in C++
—end example]
Rationale: Reinforcing type safety in C++.
Effect on original feature:Well-formed C code will not compile with this International Standard.
Difficulty of converting:Violations will be diagnosed by the C++ translator. The original behavior can be
restored with a cast or integral promotion.
[Example 4:
enum E1 { e };
enum E2 { f };
int b = (int)e <= 3.7;
int k = +f - e;
—end example]
How widely used:Uncommon.
3 Affected subclauses:7.6.1.6 and 7.6.2.3
Change: Decrement operator is not allowed withbool operand.
Rationale: Feature with surprising semantics.
Effect on original feature:A valid C expression utilizing the decrement operator on abool lvalue (for
instance, via the C typedef in<stdbool.h> (17.15.5)) is ill-formed in C++.
4 Affected subclause:7.6.2.2
Change: In certain contexts, taking the address of a dereferenced null or past-the-end pointer value is
well-defined in C (and yields the original pointer value), but results in undefined behavior in C++.
[Example 5:
void f() {
char *p = nullptr;
char *p2 = &*p; // well-defined in C, undefined behavior in C++
char *p3 = &p[0]; // well-defined in C, undefined behavior in C++
int a[5];
int *q = &a[5]; // well-defined in C, undefined behavior in C++
}
—end example]
Rationale: Consistent treatment of lvalues in C++.
Effect on original feature:Well-formed and well-defined C code exhibits undefined behavior in C++.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation to pointer arithmetic and possible addition of a check
for null pointer values.
How widely used:Occasionally.
5 Affected subclauses:7.6.2.5 and 7.6.3
Change: In C++, types can only be defined in declarations, not in expressions.
In C, asizeof expression or cast expression may define a new type.
[Example 6:
p = (void*)(struct x {int i;} *)0;
defines a new type, structx. —end example]
Rationale: This prohibition helps to clarify the location of definitions in the source code.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
6 Affected subclauses:7.6.9 and 7.6.10
Change: C allows directly comparing two objects of array type; C++ does not.
Rationale: The behavior is confusing because it compares not the contents of the two arrays, but their
addresses.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature that had unspecified behavior in
common use cases.
§ C.7.4 © ISO/IEC
2407

===== PAGE 2419 =====

Dxxxx
Difficulty of converting:Violations will be diagnosed by the C++ translator. The original behavior can be
replicated by explicitly casting either array to a pointer, such as by using a unary+.
[Example 7:
int arr1[5];
int arr2[5];
int same = arr1 == arr2; // valid C, ill-formed C++
int idem = arr1 == +arr2; // valid in both C and C++
—end example]
How widely used:Rare.
7 Affected subclauses:7.6.16, 7.6.19, and 7.6.20
Change: The result of a conditional expression, an assignment expression, or a comma expression may be
an lvalue.
Rationale: C++ is an object-oriented language, placing relatively more emphasis on lvalues. For example,
function calls may yield lvalues.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature. Some C expressions that implicitly
rely on lvalue-to-rvalue conversions will yield different results.
[Example 8:
char arr[100];
sizeof(0, arr)
yields 100 in C++ and sizeof(char*) in C. —end example]
Difficulty of converting:Programs must add explicit casts to the appropriate rvalue.
How widely used:Rare.
C.7.5 Clause 8: statements [diff.stat]
1 Affected subclauses:8.5.3 and 8.8.6
Change: It is now invalid to jump past a declaration with explicit or implicit initializer (except across entire
block not entered).
Rationale: Constructors used in initializers may allocate resources which need to be de-allocated upon
leaving the block. Allowing jump past initializers would require complicated runtime determination of
allocation. Furthermore, many operations on such an uninitialized object have undefined behavior. With this
simple compile-time rule, C++ assures that if an initialized variable is in scope, then it has assuredly been
initialized.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
2 Affected subclause:8.8.4
Change: It is now invalid to return (explicitly or implicitly) from a function which is declared to return a
value without actually returning a value.
Rationale: The caller and callee may assume fairly elaborate return-value mechanisms for the return of class
objects. If some flow paths execute a return without specifying any value, the implementation must embody
many more complications. Besides, promising to return a value of a given type, and then not returning such
a value, has always been recognized to be a questionable practice, tolerated only because very-old C had no
distinction between functions withvoid and int return types.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. Add an appropriate return value to the source code,
such as zero.
How widely used:Seldom. For several years, many existing C implementations have produced warnings in
this case.
C.7.6 Clause 9: declarations [diff.dcl]
1 Affected subclause:9.1
Change: In C++, no declaration of a variable can havecv void type. In C, this is allowed, unless the
declaration is a definition.
[Example 1:
extern void x; // valid C, invalid in C++

—end example]
Rationale: Stricter type checking in C++.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
2 Affected subclause:9.2.2
Change: In C++, thestatic or extern specifiers can only be applied to names of objects or functions.
Using these specifiers with type declarations is illegal in C++. In C, these specifiers are ignored when used on
type declarations.
[Example 2:
static struct S { // valid C, invalid in C++
int i;
};
—end example]
Rationale: Storage class specifiers don’t have any meaning when associated with a type. In C++, class
members can be declared with thestatic storage class specifier. Storage class specifiers on type declarations
can be confusing for users.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
3 Affected subclause:9.2.2
Change: In C++, register is not a storage class specifier.
Rationale: The storage class specifier had no effect in C++.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Common.
4 Affected subclause:9.2.4
Change: A C++ typedef-name must be different from any class type name declared in the same scope (except
if the typedef is a synonym of the class name with the same name). In C, atypedef-name and a struct tag
name declared in the same scope can have the same name (because they have different name spaces).
[Example 3:
typedef struct name1 { /* ... */ } name1; // valid C and C++
struct name { /* ... */ };
typedef int name; // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: For ease of use, C++ doesn’t require that a type name be prefixed with the keywordsclass,
struct or union when used in object declarations or type casts.
[Example 4:
class name { /* ... */ };
name i; // i has typeclass name
—end example]
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. One of the 2 types has to be renamed.
How widely used:Seldom.
5 Affected subclause:9.2.9 [see also 6.7]
Change: Const objects must be initialized in C++ but can be left uninitialized in C.
Rationale: A const object cannot be assigned to so it must be initialized to hold a useful value.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
6 Affected subclause:9.2.9.7
Change: The keywordauto cannot be used as a storage class specifier.
§ C.7.6 © ISO/IEC
2409

===== PAGE 2421 =====

Dxxxx
[Example 5:
void f() {
auto int x; // valid C, invalid C++
}
—end example]
Rationale: Allowing the use ofauto to deduce the type of a variable from its initializer results in undesired
interpretations ofauto as a storage class specifier in certain contexts.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Rare.
7 Affected subclause:9.3.4.6
Change: In C++, a function declared with an empty parameter list takes no arguments. In C, an empty
parameter list means that the number and type of the function arguments are unknown.
[Example 6:
int f(); // meansint f(void) in C++
// int f( unknown ) in C
—end example]
Rationale: This is to avoid function calls with the wrong number or type of arguments.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature. This feature was marked as
“obsolescent” in C.
Difficulty of converting: Syntactic transformation. The function declarations using C incomplete
declaration style must be completed to become full prototype declarations. A program may need to be
updated further if different calls to the same (non-prototype) function have different numbers of arguments
or if the type of corresponding arguments differed.
How widely used:Common.
8 Affected subclause:9.3.4.6 [see 7.6.2.5]
Change: In C++, types may not be defined in return or parameter types. In C, these type definitions are
allowed.
[Example 7:
void f( struct S { int a; } arg ) {} // valid C, invalid C++
enum E { A, B, C } f() {} // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: When comparing types in different translation units, C++ relies on name equivalence when C
relies on structural equivalence. Regarding parameter types: since the type defined in a parameter list would
be in the scope of the function, the only legal calls in C++ would be from within the function itself.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. The type definitions must be moved to file scope, or in
header files.
How widely used:Seldom. This style of type definition is seen as poor coding style.
9 Affected subclause:9.6
Change: In C++, the syntax for function definition excludes the “old-style” C function. In C, “old-style”
syntax is allowed, but deprecated as “obsolescent”.
Rationale: Prototypes are essential to type safety.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Common in old programs, but already known to be obsolescent.
10 Affected subclause:9.5.2
Change: In C++, designated initialization support is restricted compared to the corresponding functionality
in C. In C++, designators for non-static data members must be specified in declaration order, designators
for array elements and nested designators are not supported, and designated and non-designated initializers
cannot be mixed in the same initializer list.
[Example 8:
struct A { int x, y; };
struct B { struct A a; };
§ C.7.6 © ISO/IEC
2410

===== PAGE 2422 =====

Dxxxx
struct A a = {.y = 1, .x = 2}; // valid C, invalid C++
int arr[3] = {[1] = 5}; // valid C, invalid C++
struct B b = {.a.x = 0}; // valid C, invalid C++
struct A c = {.x = 1, 2}; // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: In C++, members are destroyed in reverse construction order and the elements of an initializer
list are evaluated in lexical order, so member initializers must be specified in order. Array designators conflict
with lambda-expression syntax. Nested designators are seldom used.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of feature that is incompatible with C++.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Out-of-order initializers are common. The other features are seldom used.
11 Affected subclause:9.5.3
Change: In C++, when initializing an array of character with a string, the number of characters in the
string (including the terminating’\0’) must not exceed the number of elements in the array. In C, an array
can be initialized with a string even if the array is not large enough to contain the string-terminating’\0’.
[Example 9:
char array[4] = "abcd"; // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: When these non-terminated arrays are manipulated by standard string functions, there is
potential for major catastrophe.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. The arrays must be declared one element bigger to
contain the string terminating’\0’.
How widely used:Seldom. This style of array initialization is seen as poor coding style.
12 Affected subclause:9.8.1
Change: C++ objects of enumeration type can only be assigned values of the same enumeration type. In C,
objects of enumeration type can be assigned values of any integral type.
[Example 10:
enum color { red, blue, green };
enum color c = 1; // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: The type-safe nature of C++.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation. (The type error produced by the assignment can be
automatically corrected by applying an explicit cast.)
How widely used:Common.
13 Affected subclause:9.8.1
Change: In C++, the type of an enumerator is its enumeration. In C, the type of an enumerator isint.
[Example 11:
enum e { A };
sizeof(A) == sizeof(int) // in C
sizeof(A) == sizeof(e) // in C++
/∗ and sizeof(int) is not necessarily equal tosizeof(e) ∗/
—end example]
Rationale: In C++, an enumeration is a distinct type.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom. The only time this affects existing C code is when the size of an enumerator is
taken. Taking the size of an enumerator is not a common C coding practice.
14 Affected subclause:9.13.2
Change: In C++, analignment-specifier is anattribute-specifier. In C, analignment-specifier is adeclaration-
specifier.
§ C.7.6 © ISO/IEC
2411

===== PAGE 2423 =====

Dxxxx
[Example 12:
#include <stdalign.h>
unsigned alignas(8) int x; // valid C, invalid C++
unsigned int y alignas(8); // valid C++, invalid C
—end example]
Rationale: C++ requires unambiguous placement of thealignment-specifier.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
C.7.7 Clause 11: classes [diff.class]
1 Affected subclause:11.3 [see also 9.2.4]
Change: In C++, a class declaration introduces the class name into the scope where it is declared and hides
any object, function or other declaration of that name in an enclosing scope. In C, an inner scope declaration
of a struct tag name never hides the name of an object or function in an outer scope.
[Example 1:
int x[99];
void f() {
struct x { int a; };
sizeof(x); /∗ size of the array in C∗/
/∗ size of the struct in C++ ∗/
}
—end example]
Rationale: This is one of the few incompatibilities between C and C++ that can be attributed to the new
C++ name space definition where a name can be declared as a type and as a non-type in a single scope
causing the non-type name to hide the type name and requiring that the keywordsclass, struct, union
or enum be used to refer to the type name. This new name space definition provides important notational
conveniences to C++ programmers and helps making the use of the user-defined types as similar as possible
to the use of fundamental types. The advantages of the new name space definition were judged to outweigh
by far the incompatibility with C described above.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. If the hidden name that needs to be accessed is at
global scope, the:: C++ operator can be used. If the hidden name is at block scope, either the type or the
struct tag has to be renamed.
How widely used:Seldom.
2 Affected subclause:11.4.5.3
Change: Copying volatile objects.
The implicitly-declared copy constructor and implicitly-declared copy assignment operator cannot make a
copy of a volatile lvalue.
[Example 2: The following is valid in C:
struct X { int i; };
volatile struct X x1 = {0};
struct X x2 = x1; // invalid C++
struct X x3;
x3 = x1; // also invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: Several alternatives were debated at length. Changing the parameter tovolatile const X&
would greatly complicate the generation of efficient code for class objects. Discussion of providing two
alternative signatures for these implicitly-defined operations raised unanswered concerns about creating
ambiguities and complicating the rules that specify the formation of these operators according to the bases
and members.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. If volatile semantics are required for the copy, a
user-declared constructor or assignment must be provided. If non-volatile semantics are required, an explicit

Dxxxx
const_cast can be used.
How widely used:Seldom.
3 Affected subclause:11.4.10
Change: Bit-fields of type plainint are signed.
Rationale: The signedness needs to be consistent among template specializations. For consistency, the
implementation freedom was eliminated for non-dependent types, too.
Effect on original feature:The choice is implementation-defined in C, but not so in C++.
Difficulty of converting:Syntactic transformation.
How widely used:Seldom.
4 Affected subclause:11.4.12
Change: In C++, the name of a nested class is local to its enclosing class. In C the name of the nested class
belongs to the same scope as the name of the outermost enclosing class.
[Example 3:
struct X {
struct Y { /* ... */ } y;
};
struct Y yy; // valid C, invalid C++
—end example]
Rationale: C++ classes have member functions which require that classes establish scopes. The C rule would
leave classes as an incomplete scope mechanism which would prevent C++ programmers from maintaining
locality within a class. A coherent set of scope rules for C++ based on the C rule would be very complicated
and C++ programmers would be unable to predict reliably the meanings of nontrivial examples involving
nested or local functions.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation. To make the struct type name visible in the scope of
the enclosing struct, the struct tag can be declared in the scope of the enclosing struct, before the enclosing
struct is defined.
[Example 4:
struct Y; // struct Y and struct X are at the same scope
struct X {
struct Y { /* ... */ } y;
};
—end example]
All the definitions of C struct types enclosed in other struct definitions and accessed outside the scope of
the enclosing struct can be exported to the scope of the enclosing struct. Note: this is a consequence of the
difference in scope rules, which is documented in 6.4.
How widely used:Seldom.
5 Affected subclause:6.5.2
Change: In C++, a typedef-name may not be redeclared in a class definition after being used in that
definition.
[Example 5:
typedef int I;
struct S {
I i;
int I; // valid C, invalid C++
};
—end example]
Rationale: When classes become complicated, allowing such a redefinition after the type has been used can
create confusion for C++ programmers as to what the meaning ofI really is.
Effect on original feature:Deletion of semantically well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting: Semantic transformation. Either the type or the struct member has to be
renamed.
How widely used:Seldom.

C.7.8 Clause 15: preprocessing directives [diff.cpp]
1 Affected subclause:15.12
Change: Whether __STDC__ is defined and if so, what its value is, are implementation-defined.
Rationale: C++ is not identical to C. Mandating that__STDC__ be defined would require that translators
make an incorrect claim.
Effect on original feature:Change to semantics of well-defined feature.
Difficulty of converting:Semantic transformation.
How widely used:Programs and headers that reference__STDC__ are quite common.
C.8 C standard library [diff.library]
C.8.1 General [diff.library.general]
1 Subclause C.8 summarizes the explicit changes in headers, definitions, declarations, or behavior between the
C standard library in the C standard and the parts of the C++ standard library that were included from the
C standard library.
C.8.2 Modifications to headers [diff.mods.to.headers]
1 For compatibility with the C standard library, the C++ standard library provides the C headers enumerated
in 17.15.
2 There are no C++ headers for the C standard library’s headers<stdnoreturn.h> and <threads.h>, nor are
these headers from the C standard library headers themselves part of C++.
3 The C headers<complex.h> and <tgmath.h> do not contain any of the content from the C standard library
and instead merely include other headers from the C++ standard library.
C.8.3 Modifications to definitions [diff.mods.to.definitions]
C.8.3.1 Types char8_t, char16_t, andchar32_t [diff.char16]
1 The typeschar8_t, char16_t, andchar32_t are distinct types rather than typedefs to existing integral
types. The tokenschar8_t, char16_t, andchar32_t are keywords in C++ (5.12). They do not appear as
macro or type names defined in<cuchar> (28.7.4).
C.8.3.2 Type wchar_t [diff.wchar.t]
1 The typewchar_t is a distinct type rather than a typedef to an existing integral type. The tokenwchar_t is
a keyword in C++ (5.12). It does not appear as a macro or type name defined in any of<cstddef> (17.2.1),
<cstdlib> (17.2.2), or<cwchar> (28.7.3).
C.8.3.3 Header <iso646.h> [diff.header.iso646.h]
1 The tokensand, and_eq, bitand, bitor, compl, not, not_eq, or, or_eq, xor, andxor_eq are keywords in
C++ (5.12), and are not introduced as macros by<iso646.h> (17.15.3).
C.8.3.4 Macro NULL [diff.null]
1 The macroNULL, defined in any of<clocale> (28.3.5.1), <cstddef> (17.2.1), <cstdio> (31.13.1), <cstdlib>
(17.2.2), <cstring> (27.5.1), <ctime> (30.15), or<cwchar> (28.7.3), is an implementation-defined null pointer
constant in C++ (17.2).
C.8.4 Modifications to declarations [diff.mods.to.declarations]
1 Header <cstring> (27.5.1): The following functions have different declarations:
—(1.1) strchr
—(1.2) strpbrk
—(1.3) strrchr
—(1.4) strstr
—(1.5) memchr
Subclause 27.5.1 describes the changes.

—(2.2) wcspbrk
—(2.3) wcsrchr
—(2.4) wcsstr

Subclause 28.7.3 describes the changes.
3 Header <cstddef> (17.2.1) declares the namesnullptr_t, byte, andto_integer, and the operators and
operator templates in 17.2.5, in addition to the names declared in<stddef.h> (17.15) in the C standard
library.
C.8.5 Modifications to behavior [diff.mods.to.behavior]
C.8.5.1 General [diff.mods.to.behavior.general]
1 Header <cstdlib> (17.2.2): The following functions have different behavior:
—(1.1) atexit
—(1.2) exit
—(1.3) abort
Subclause 17.5 describes the changes.
2 Header <csetjmp> (17.14.3): The following functions have different behavior:
—(2.1) longjmp
Subclause 17.14.3 describes the changes.
C.8.5.2 Macro offsetof(type, member-designator) [diff.offsetof]
1 The macrooffsetof, defined in<cstddef> (17.2.1), accepts a restricted set oftype arguments in C++.
Subclause 17.2.4 describes the change.
C.8.5.3 Memory allocation functions [diff.malloc]
1 The functions aligned_alloc, calloc, malloc, and realloc are restricted in C++. Subclause 20.2.12

Annex D
(normative)
Compatibility features [depr]
D.1 General [depr.general]
1 This Annex describes features of this document that are specified for compatibility with existing implementa-
tions.
2 These are deprecated features, wheredeprecatedis defined as: Normative for the current revision of C++, but
having been identified as a candidate for removal from future revisions. An implementation may declare
library names and entities described in this Clause with thedeprecated attribute (9.13.4).
D.2 Non-local use of TU-local entities [depr.local]
1 A declaration of a non-TU-local entity that is an exposure (6.7) is deprecated.
[Note 1: Such a declaration in an importable module unit is ill-formed.—end note]
[Example 1:
namespace {
struct A {
void f() {}
};
}
A h(); // deprecated: not internal linkage
inline void g() {A().f();} // deprecated: inline and not internal linkage
—end example]
D.3 Implicit capture of *this by reference [depr.capture.this]
1 For compatibility with prior revisions of C++, a lambda-expression with capture-default = (7.5.6.3) may
implicitly capture*this by reference.
[Example 1:
struct X {
int x;
void foo(int n) {
auto f = [=]() { x = n; }; // deprecated:x means this->x, not a copy thereof
auto g = [=, this]() { x = n; }; // recommended replacement
}
};
—end example]
D.4 Deprecated volatile types [depr.volatile.type]
1 Postfix++and--expressions (7.6.1.6) and prefix++and--expressions (7.6.2.3) of volatile-qualified arithmetic
and pointer types are deprecated.
[Example 1:
volatile int velociraptor;
++velociraptor; // deprecated

3 A function type (9.3.4.6) with a parameter with volatile-qualified type or with a volatile-qualified return type
is deprecated.
[Example 3:
volatile struct amber jurassic(); // deprecated
void trex(volatile short left_arm, volatile short right_arm); // deprecated
void fly(volatile struct pterosaur* pteranodon); // OK

struct linhenykus { short forelimb; };
void park(linhenykus alvarezsauroid) {
volatile auto [what_is_this] = alvarezsauroid; // deprecated
// ...
}

D.5 Non-comma-separated ellipsis parameters [depr.ellipsis.comma]
A parameter-declaration-clause of the formparameter-declaration-list ... is deprecated (9.3.4.6).
[Example 1:
void f(int...); // deprecated
void g(auto...); // OK, declares a function parameter pack
void h(auto......); // deprecated
—end example]
D.6 Implicit declaration of copy functions [depr.impldec]
1 The implicit definition of a copy constructor (11.4.5.3) as defaulted is deprecated if the class has a user-
declared copy assignment operator or a user-declared destructor (11.4.7). The implicit definition of a copy
assignment operator (11.4.6) as defaulted is deprecated if the class has a user-declared copy constructor or a
user-declared destructor. It is possible that future versions of C++ will specify that these implicit definitions
are deleted (9.6.3).
D.7 Redeclaration of static constexpr data members [depr.static.constexpr]
1 For compatibility with prior revisions of C++, aconstexpr static data member may be redundantly redeclared
outside the class with no initializer (6.2, 11.4.9.3). This usage is deprecated.
[Example 1:
struct A {
static constexpr int n = 5; // definition (declaration in C++ 2014)
};
constexpr int A::n; // redundant declaration (definition in C++ 2014)
—end example]
D.8 Literal operator function declarations using an identifier [depr.lit]

A trivial typeis a scalar type, a trivial class, an array of such a type, or a cv-qualified version of one of these
types.
4 A POD classis a class that is both a trivial class and a standard-layout class, and has no non-static data
members of type non-POD class (or array thereof). APOD typeis a scalar type, a POD class, an array of
such a type, or a cv-qualified version of one of these types.
template<class T> struct is_trivial;
5 Preconditions: remove_all_extents_t<T> shall be a complete type orcv void.
6 Remarks: is_trivial<T> is aCpp17UnaryTypeTrait(21.3.2) with a base characteristic oftrue_type
if T is a trivial type, andfalse_type otherwise.
7 [Note 2: It is unspecified whether a closure type (7.5.6.2) is a trivial type.—end note]
template<class T> struct is_pod;
8 Preconditions: remove_all_extents_t<T> shall be a complete type orcv void.
9 Remarks: is_pod<T> is aCpp17UnaryTypeTrait(21.3.2) with a base characteristic oftrue_type if T
is a POD type, andfalse_type otherwise.

template<size_t Len, size_t Align = default-alignment >
struct aligned_storage;
11 The value ofdefault-alignment is the most stringent alignment requirement for any object type
whose size is no greater thanLen (6.9).
12 Mandates: Len is not zero.Align is equal toalignof(T) for some typeT or todefault-alignment .
13 The member typedeftype denotes a trivial standard-layout type suitable for use as uninitialized storage
for any object whose size is at mostLen and whose alignment is a divisor ofAlign.
14 [Note 4: Uses ofaligned_storage<Len, Align>::type can be replaced by an arraystd::byte[Len] declared
with alignas(Align). —end note]
15 [Note 5: A typical implementation would definealigned_storage as:
template<size_t Len, size_t Alignment>
struct aligned_storage {
typedef struct {
alignas(Alignment) unsigned char __data[Len];
} type;
};

template<size_t Len, class... Types>
struct aligned_union;
16 Mandates: At least one type is provided. Each type in the template parameter packTypes is a complete
object type.
17 The member typedef type denotes a trivial standard-layout type suitable for use as uninitialized
storage for any object whose type is listed inTypes; its size shall be at leastLen. The static member
alignment_value is an integral constant of typesize_t whose value is the strictest alignment of all
types listed inTypes.
D.14 Relational operators [depr.relops]
1 The header<utility> (22.2.1) has the following additions:
namespace std::rel_ops {
template<class T> bool operator!=(const T&, const T&);
template<class T> bool operator> (const T&, const T&);
template<class T> bool operator<=(const T&, const T&);
template<class T> bool operator>=(const T&, const T&);
}
2 To avoid redundant definitions ofoperator!= out of operator== and operators >, <=, and >= out of
operator<, the library provides the following:
template<class T> bool operator!=(const T& x, const T& y);
3 Preconditions: T meets theCpp17EqualityComparable requirements (Table 28).
4 Returns: !(x == y).
template<class T> bool operator>(const T& x, const T& y);
5 Preconditions: T meets theCpp17LessThanComparablerequirements (Table 29).
6 Returns: y < x.
template<class T> bool operator<=(const T& x, const T& y);
7 Preconditions: T meets theCpp17LessThanComparablerequirements (Table 29).
8 Returns: !(y < x).
template<class T> bool operator>=(const T& x, const T& y);

template<size_t I, class T> struct tuple_element<I, const volatile T>;
}
template<class T> struct tuple_size<volatile T>;
template<class T> struct tuple_size<const volatile T>;
2 Let TS denote tuple_size<T> of the cv-unqualified typeT. If the expressionTS::value is well-formed
when treated as an unevaluated operand (7.2.3), then specializations of each of the two templates meet
the Cpp17TransformationTraitrequirements with a base characteristic ofintegral_constant<size_t,
TS::value>. Otherwise, they have no membervalue.
3 Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated toTS and T. Only the validity of the immediate
context of the expression is considered.

template<class T> struct variant_size<const volatile T>;
template<size_t I, class T> struct variant_alternative<I, volatile T>;
template<size_t I, class T> struct variant_alternative<I, const volatile T>;
}
template<class T> struct variant_size<volatile T>;
template<class T> struct variant_size<const volatile T>;
2 Let VS denote variant_size<T> of the cv-unqualified typeT. Then specializations of each of the
two templates meet theCpp17UnaryTypeTraitrequirements with a base characteristic ofintegral_-
constant<size_t, VS::value>.
template<size_t I, class T> struct variant_alternative<I, volatile T>;
template<size_t I, class T> struct variant_alternative<I, const volatile T>;
3 Let VA denote variant_alternative<I, T> of the cv-unqualified typeT. Then specializations of each
of the two templates meet theCpp17TransformationTraitrequirements with a member typedeftype
that names the following type:
—(3.1) for the first specialization,volatile VA::type, and
—(3.2) for the second specialization,const volatile VA::type.
D.17 Deprecated vector<bool, Allocator> swap [depr.vector.bool.swap]

namespace std {
template<class Allocator> class vector<bool, Allocator> {
public:
static constexpr void swap(reference x, reference y) noexcept;

x = y;
y = b;
D.18 Deprecated iterator class template [depr.iterator]
1 The header<iterator> (24.2) has the following addition:
§ D.18 © ISO/IEC
2421

===== PAGE 2433 =====

Dxxxx
namespace std {
template<class Category, class T, class Distance = ptrdiff_t,
class Pointer = T*, class Reference = T&>
struct iterator {
using iterator_category = Category;
using value_type = T;
using difference_type = Distance;
using pointer = Pointer;
using reference = Reference;
};
}
2 The iterator template may be used as a base class to ease the definition of required types for new iterators.
3 [Note 1: If the new iterator type is a class template, then these aliases will not be visible from within the iterator
class’s template definition, but only to callers of that class.—end note]
4 [Example 1: If a C++ program wants to define a bidirectional iterator for some data structure containingdouble and
such that it works on a large memory model of the implementation, it can do so with:
class MyIterator :
public iterator<bidirectional_iterator_tag, double, long, T*, T&> {
// code implementing++, etc.
};
—end example]
D.19 Deprecated move_iterator access [depr.move.iter.elem]

codecvt<char32_t, char, mbstate_t>
codecvt<char16_t, char8_t, mbstate_t>
codecvt<char32_t, char8_t, mbstate_t>
2 The ctype locale category includes the following facets as if they were specified in Table 92 of 28.3.3.1.2.1.
codecvt_byname<char16_t, char, mbstate_t>
codecvt_byname<char32_t, char, mbstate_t>
codecvt_byname<char16_t, char8_t, mbstate_t>
codecvt_byname<char32_t, char8_t, mbstate_t>
3 The following class template specializations are required in addition to those specified in 28.3.4.2.5. The spe-
cializations codecvt<char16_t, char, mbstate_t> and codecvt<char16_t, char8_t, mbstate_t> con-
vert between the UTF-16 and UTF-8 encoding forms, and the specializationscodecvt<char32_t, char,
mbstate_t> and codecvt<char32_t, char8_t, mbstate_t> convert between the UTF-32 and UTF-8 en-
coding forms.
D.21 Deprecated formatting [depr.format]
D.21.1 Header <format> synopsis [depr.format.syn]
1 The header<format> (28.5.1) has the following additions:

template<class Visitor, class Context>
decltype(auto) visit_format_arg(Visitor&& vis, basic_format_arg<Context> arg);
1 Effects: Equivalent to:return visit(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), arg.value);
D.22 Deprecated time formatting [depr.ctime]
1 The header<ctime> (30.15) has the following additions:
char* asctime(const tm* timeptr);
char* ctime(const time_t* timer);
2 The functionsasctime and ctime are not required to avoid data races (16.4.6.10).
See also: ISO/IEC 9899:2024, 7.29
D.23 Deprecated file systems [depr.filesystems]
D.23.1 Deprecated filesystem path factory functions [depr.fs.path.factory]
1 The header<filesystem> (31.12.4) has the following additions:
template<class Source>
path u8path(const Source& source);
template<class InputIterator>
path u8path(InputIterator first, InputIterator last);
2 Mandates: The value type ofSource and InputIterator is char or char8_t.
3 Preconditions: The source and [first,last) sequences are UTF-8 encoded. Source meets the
requirements specified in 31.12.6.4.
4 Returns:
—(4.1) If path::value_type is char and the current native narrow encoding (31.12.6.3.2) is UTF-8,
return path(source) or path(first, last); otherwise,
—(4.2) if path::value_type is wchar_t and the native wide encoding is UTF-16, or ifpath::value_-
type is char16_t or char32_t, convert source or [first,last) to a temporary,tmp, of type
path::string_type and returnpath(tmp); otherwise,
—(4.3) convert source or [first,last) to a temporary,tmp, of typeu32string and returnpath(tmp).
5 Remarks: Argument format conversion (31.12.6.3.1) applies to the arguments for these functions. How
Unicode encoding conversions are performed is unspecified.
6 [Example 1: A string is to be read from a database that is encoded in UTF-8, and used to create a directory
using the native encoding for filenames:
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
std::string utf8_string = read_utf8_data();
fs::create_directory(fs::u8path(utf8_string));
For POSIX-based operating systems with the native narrow encoding set to UTF-8, no encoding or type
conversion occurs.
For POSIX-based operating systems with the native narrow encoding not set to UTF-8, a conversion to UTF-32
occurs, followed by a conversion to the current native narrow encoding. Some Unicode characters may have no
native character set representation.
For Windows-based operating systems a conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16 occurs.—end example]
[Note 1: The example above is representative of a historical use offilesystem::u8path. To indicate a UTF-8
encoding, passing astd::u8string to path’s constructor is preferred as it is consistent withpath’s handling of
other encodings. —end note]

Annex E
(informative)
Conformance with UAX#31 [uaxid]
E.1 General [uaxid.general]
1 This Annex describes the choices made in application of UAX#31 (“Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax”)
to C++ in terms of the requirements from UAX#31 and how they do or do not apply to this document.
In terms of UAX#31, this document conforms by meeting the requirements R1 “Default Identifiers” and
R4 “Equivalent Normalized Identifiers” from UAX#31. The other requirements from UAX#31, also listed
below, are either alternatives not taken or do not apply to this document.
E.2 R1 Default identifiers [uaxid.def]
E.2.1 General [uaxid.def.general]
1 UAX #31 specifies a default syntax for identifiers based on properties from the Unicode Character Database,
UAX #44. The general syntax is
<Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>* (<Medial> <Continue>+)*
where <Start> has the XID_Start property,<Continue> has the XID_Continue property, and<Medial> is
a list of characters permitted between continue characters. For C++ we add the characteru+005f low line,
or _, to the set of permitted<Start> characters, the<Medial> set is empty, and the<Continue> characters
are unmodified. In the grammar used in UAX#31, this is
<Identifier> := <Start> <Continue>*
<Start> := XID_Start + @\textrm{\ucode{005f}}@
<Continue> := <Start> + XID_Continue
2 This is described in the C++ grammar in 5.11, whereidentifier is formed fromidentifier-start or identifier
followed byidentifier-continue.
E.2.2 R1b Stable identifiers [uaxid.def.stable]
1 An implementation of UAX#31 may choose to guarantee that identifiers are stable across versions of the
Unicode Standard. Once a string qualifies as an identifier it does so in all future versions.
2 C++ does not make this guarantee, except to the extent that UAX#31 guarantees the stability of the
XID_Start and XID_Continue properties.
E.3 R2 Immutable identifiers [uaxid.immutable]
1 An implementation may choose to guarantee that the set of identifiers will never change by fixing the set of
code points allowed in identifiers forever.
2 C++ does not choose to make this guarantee. As scripts are added to Unicode, additional characters in those
scripts may become available for use in identifiers.
E.4 R3 Pattern_White_Space and Pattern_Syntax characters [uaxid.pattern]
1 UAX #31 describes how formal languages such as computer languages should describe and implement their
use of whitespace and syntactically significant characters during the processes of lexing and parsing.
2 This document does not claim conformance with this requirement from UAX#31.
§ E.4 © ISO/IEC
2426

===== PAGE 2438 =====

Dxxxx
E.5 R4 Equivalent normalized identifiers [uaxid.eqn]
1 UAX #31 requires that implementations describe how identifiers are compared and considered equivalent.
2 This document requires that identifiers be in Normalization Form C and therefore identifiers that compare
the same under NFC are equivalent. This is described in 5.11.
E.6 R5 Equivalent case-insensitive identifiers [uaxid.eqci]
1 This document considers case to be significant in identifier comparison, and does not do any case folding.
This requirement from UAX#31 does not apply to this document.
E.7 R6 Filtered normalized identifiers [uaxid.filter]
1 If any characters are excluded from normalization, UAX#31 requires a precise specification of those exclusions.
2 This document does not make any such exclusions.
E.8 R7 Filtered case-insensitive identifiers [uaxid.filterci]
1 C++ identifiers are case sensitive, and therefore this requirement from UAX#31 does not apply.
E.9 R8 Hashtag identifiers [uaxid.hashtag]
1 There are no hashtags in C++, so this requirement from UAX#31 does not apply.
