Improve a documentation page
****************************

We are always interested to hear ideas about improvements to the
documentation.

You have a few ways to ask questions or suggest changes:

* You can start a discussion about the page on the Python discussion
  forum. This link will start a topic in the Documentation category:
  New Documentation topic.

* You can open an issue on the Python GitHub issue tracker. This link
  will create a new issue with the "docs" label: New docs issue.
